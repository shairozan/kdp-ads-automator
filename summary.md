## Potential Optimizations

Based on this data, consider:

1. **Reduce keyword bids** - Current ACOS is too high; lowering bids could improve profitability
2. **Pause underperforming keywords** - Identify which keywords are driving high ACOS
3. **Adjust budgets** - Shift budget toward better-performing campaign if one outperforms the other
4. **Add negative keywords** - Block irrelevant search terms that generate clicks but no sales
